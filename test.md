# 1. MARVEL TASKS REPORT
## 1.1. OVERALL EXPERIENCE
It was really interesting to learn and experience all the *trending domains of technology*. I was overwhelmed to learn new things, work on it and execute it physically.

### 1.1.1. TASK 1 : **3-D PRINTING**
3-D printing is a fascinating technology. In this task we had to learn the working of a 3D printer and print a model. I chose to print a small model of Donald Duc. I learnt about SIT files and then learned to slice it and then downloading file, slicing it and put it to print.

### 1.1.2. TASK 2 : **COMMAND LINE ON UBUNTU**
Command line interface is useful tool used for interacting with the operating system. They help us to manage files and perform useful tasks. In this task we learnt to create a folder and also learnt to concatenate two text files containig any random text.

### 1.1.3. TASK 3 : **WORKING WITH PANDAS AND MATPLOTLIB**
This task is an introduction to data visualization. In this task I chose a weather dataset and plotted a line graph, bar graph and scatter plot using paandas and matplotlib in python.

### 1.1.4. TASK 4 : **SPEED CONTROL OF DC MOTOR**
In this task, the circuit consisted of Ardunio board, motor driver, breadboard, motor, battery and a potentiometer. The reference code was uploaded to the Ardunio board using Ardunio IDE and the speed of the motor was controlled using the potentiomotor.

### 1.1.5. TASK 5 : **KAGGLE CONTEST**
Kaggle is the world's largest data science community with powerful tools and resurces to help achieve data science goals. In this competition we use machine learning to predict survival outcomes based on the passenger data in the Titanic shipwreck.

## 1.2. TASK 6 : **TINKERCAD**
This task enabled us to get an introduction to TINKERCAD. In this task we had to create a radar system using ultrasonic sensor and servo motor to detect objects within certain range. Here the ultrasonic sensor emits sound waves and measures the time taken for them to bounce and servo motor rotates the sensor to cover a wide area, providing a simple yet effective detection mechanism.

### 1.2.1. TASK 7 : **555 ASTABLE MULTIVIBRATOR WITH       DUTY CYCLE 60%**
In this task three-5 kilo-ohm resistors used in original design in its internal voltage divider network. 555 timer IC produces continuous square wave or pulse wave output, commonly used for generating clock signals and time keeping in digital circuits. This makes it useeful for geerating clock pulses, tone generation and various timing applictions. Also an oscilloscope is used to visualize electrical signal as they vary over time.

### 1.2.2. TASK 8: **WORKING WITH GITHUB**
Github is an online software development platform. It is used to store, track and collaborate on software projects. This task helped me get familiarize with github and I learnt about pull requests, forking etc.

### 1.2.3. TASK 9 : **LED TOGGLE USING ESP32**
The ESP32 is a versatile Wi-Fi and Bluetooth enabled microcontroller widely used in IoT projects. In this task a web server was created which helped to toggle the LED connection with ESP32. The code was uploaded to the ESP32 using Ardunio IDE.

### 1.2.4. TASK 10 : **SOLDERING PREREQUISITES**
Soldering is the process used for joining metal parts using a filler metal called solder. In this task we learnt about flux, electronic copper board and soldering iron. I soldered a small LED to electronic board which was later connected to check its working.
